Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Software engineering can be described as the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of the software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three key milestone in soft engineering include the development of the programming languages. 
The Creation of Structured Programming. This is a method dates back to the 1960s. It pinpoint logical and clear control structures rather than utilising complex and unorginized jumps.
The Waterfall Model - This nethod dates back to the 1970s. This method uses a step-bystep process for developing a software. Its breaks down the deevelopment into easily distinguishable phases, namely: understanding requirements, designing solutions, writing code, testing and maintancence. 
Third key milestone was The Aginle Movement, dating back to the 2000s. This type of method adopted a flexible approach to software development that mainly focuses on delivering small, working pieces of software frequently and adapting quickly to changes.    
  
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1 Requirements is a planning stage where documents are gathered, establishing the needs of the user and the requirements of the system.
 2 Design phase entails a detailed design that is high-level blueprint of the software architecture as well as the user interface.
 3 Implementation phase entails 
 Testing is a phase where the software is being tested to ensure that it meets the quality standards and functional requirements 
 Deployment is a phase where a software is being release to the users or customers 
 Maintenance is the phase where the software is kept functioning and upt-to-date

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method is a conventional approach to software development where you have to follow a strict a strict sequence. You must complete one step before moving onto the next step. Agile method can be characterised as a more flexible approach to software development where you work in small iterative cycles. This method involves continous cycle of planning, development, testing and review.
Incomparison: Waterfall method follows a linear, step-by-step proccess where each step needs to be comleted before starting the next one. WHere as, Agile utilises iterative cycles, ensuring a continous improvements and adjustments as the project progresses. 
Waterfall is appropriate in projets with well-defined requiredments beacuse it is best applies where there is a clear structure.
Agile is appropriate where there are changes to requirements along the way, regardless of the size of the project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementation of software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suits that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debuging and testing code. Example of IDE is Visual Studio.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source abd code and coordinating work among the team members. Example of VCS is Git  

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements - requirements may change during the development cycle and that may lead to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines - pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed developemtn and compromised quality.
Technical Dedt - Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for overcoming softwater challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing entails testing individual components or modules of the software.
Intergration Testing entails testing interactions between the different components or subsystems.
Acceptance Testing entails testing the software against user requirements to ensure that it meets the user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering entails crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from all AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
My vague promt was "I want to know about vehicles", I got a lot of general resposes that were long and confusing. With a wide range of topics.  
I then improved my promt to "I want to know about benefits of electric vehicles, manufactured in Africa" 
The responses were more focused, clear and specific.
